# Keys VS Refs

The names of these attributes speak for themselves: both keys and refs are used to identify particular elements in the DOM, however their purposes are different.

# Keys

Keys React are utilised to identify specific Virtual DOM Elements that have changed.

# Refs

Similarly to keys refs are added to elements in the form of attributes.
Usually props are the way for parent components interact with their children. However in some cases you might need to modify a child without re-rendering it with new props. That’s exactly when refs attribute comes to use.

Refs can be created in 3 ways:

-String Type

-Callback Function

-CreateRef() method

-String Refs
